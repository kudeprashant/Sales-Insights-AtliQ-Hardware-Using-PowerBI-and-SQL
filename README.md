## Problem Statement :

In this project performed India based AtliQ hardware company sales insights - A Data Analysis project. 

AtliQ Hardware is a company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many of clients such as surge stores, Nomad stores etc. across India. AtliQ Hardware head office is situated in Delhi, India and they have many regional office through out the India.

Sales director for this company is facing a lot of challenges is this the market is growing dynamically and sales director is facing issue in terms of tracking the sales in this dynamical growth market and he is having issues with growth of this bussiness, as overall sales was declining. He has regional manager for North India, South and Central India. Whenever he wants to get insights of thses region he would call these people and on the phone regional manager give some insights to him that this was the sales last quarter and we are going to grow by this much in the next quarter.

The problem was that all thses thing happening is verbal and these was mo proof with facts that how his business is affected and which made him frustraed as he can see that overall sales is declining but when he can ask regional manager, he is not getting complete picture of this bussiness and when he and this AtliQ hardware is big business. so to see insights clearly. and he will get proper insights anbd can take data driven decision to increase sales of hos company.
All he wants is a simple data visualization tool which he can access on daily basis. By using such tools and technology one can make data driven decisiions which helps to increase the sales of the company. So, In this projects we will help a company make its own sales related dashboard using power BI.

## Data Discovery :

- #### Project Planning using AIMS Grid -

  It is a project management tool which consists of four components-
  
     - Purpose - (What to do exactly)
     - Stackholder - (Who will be involved)
     - End result - (What do you want to achieve)
     - Success Criteria - (Cost optimization and time save)
 - #### AIMS Grid -
     **1. Purpose :-** To unlock sales insights that are not visible before for the sales them for decision support and automate them to reduced manual time spent in data gathering.
     
     **2. Stakeholders :-** 
     - Sales Director
     - Marketing Team 
     - Customer Service Team
     - Data and Analytics Team
     - IT 
     
     **3. End result :-** An automated dashboard providing quick and latest sights in order to support Data driven decision making.
     
     **4. Success Criteria :-**
     - Dahboard uncovering sales order insights with latest data available
     - Sales team able to take better decisions and prove 10% cost saving of total spend.
     - Sales analysis stop data gathering manually in order to save 20% business time andreinvest it value added activity.

## Data Analysis using MySQL
Completed the Data discovery and then used mySQL for data analysis. SQL database dump is in db_dump.sql file above. Download db_dump.sql file to your local computer.

- Importing Data to MySQL workbench.
- Analysis of data by looking into different tables and reflecting garbage values.
- Analysis of different SQL statement on database by executing complex SQL queries.

## Data Cleaning and ETL(Extract, Transform, & Load)

In the realm of data analysis, the process of data cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data we work with is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Below are the detailed steps involved in our data cleaning and ETL process:

**Step 1: Connect to MySQL Database with PowerBI Desktop**- 
The journey begins by establishing a connection between our MySQL database and PowerBI Desktop. This connection serves as the bridge through which raw data is accessed, setting the stage for comprehensive analysis.

**Step 2: Load Data into Power BI Desktop**- 
During this step, all tables created within the database are loaded into Power BI Desktop. This loading process establishes a seamless connection with the SQL database, pulling in all the records and populating the Power BI environment. The integration of data from the source to Power BI is fundamental for subsequent analysis and visualization.

**Step 3: Transform Data Using Power Query**- 
The heart of the data cleaning and ETL process lies in transforming the raw data into a structured and usable format. Power Query comes to our aid, enabling us to cleanse and reshape the dataset. Through various transformations and manipulations, inconsistencies are resolved, missing values are handled, and the data is refined to align with our analytical objectives.
Once the dataset undergoes this meticulous cleaning and transformation, it emerges prepared for the next stage: data modeling. With a clean and structured dataset in hand, we are equipped to delve into advanced analytics, uncover patterns, and extract meaningful insights that drive informed decision-making.

This process ensures that the data we analyze is not just accurate but also optimized for deriving valuable insights, making it an integral part of our data analysis workflow.

## Building Dashboards or Reports

In this pivotal step, we leverage the power of Power BI Desktop to craft comprehensive dashboards and reports. Utilizing a range of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) measures, we delve deep into data visualization, transforming raw data into actionable insights. DAX, a powerful formula language, enables us to create calculated columns, tables, and advanced measures, enhancing the granularity of our analysis.
